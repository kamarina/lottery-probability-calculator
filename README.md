## Example

```bash
Enter the total number of tickets: 10
Enter the number of winning tickets: 2
Enter the number of tickets sold: 1

The chance that a winning ticket is not sold is: 0.8000 or 80.00%
Enter the number of tickets you consider buying (enter 0 to exit): 3
Probability of winning when buying 3 ticket(s) is: 0.4286 or 42.86%

Do you want to (R)e-enter all values, (C)hange the number of tickets, or (E)xit? C
Enter the number of tickets you consider buying (enter 0 to exit): 5
Probability of winning when buying 5 ticket(s) is: 0.2000 or 20.00%

Do you want to (R)e-enter all values, (C)hange the number of tickets, or (E)xit? E
Exiting the program.
